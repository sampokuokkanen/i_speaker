Building AI-Powered Ruby Applications
=====================================

Description: Learn how to integrate AI capabilities into your Ruby applications using local models
Target Audience: Ruby developers
Duration: 25 minutes

1. Introduction to AI in Ruby Applications
------------------------------------------
• Ruby provides excellent support for building AI-powered applications through libraries like NLPGem, Rake-NLP, and Ruby Natural Language Processing (RNL).
• Many popular Ruby frameworks such as Rails and Sinatra have integrated gems that enable AI capabilities, making it easier to incorporate machine learning into existing projects.
• Ruby developers can leverage the power of Ruby's meta-programming features to implement their own machine learning algorithms or integrate third-party libraries for more complex tasks.
• By utilizing tools like TensorFlow.js and PyTorch, developers can utilize popular deep learning frameworks directly within their Ruby applications.

Notes: Explain introduction to ai in ruby applications with practical examples and encourage audience questions.

2. Setting up Ollama for Local AI
---------------------------------
• To set up Ollama for local AI, create a new Ruby project and add the following dependencies to your Gemfile: `ollama` and `activesupport`.
• Next, initialize the Ollama library in your main application file (e.g., app.rb) by calling `Ollama.init()` before booting up your Ruby application.
• Configure the Ollama model by creating a new class that inherits from `Ollama::Model` and defines the AI capabilities you want to use, such as classification or regression.
• Use the `ollama` gem's built-in APIs, such as `model.predict()` or `dataset.load()`, to interact with your local Ollama instance within your Ruby application.

3. Creating Simple Chat Interfaces
----------------------------------
• Use Ruby's built-in `require` method to include the necessary libraries for creating chat interfaces, such as Twilio or Nexmo APIs.
• Utilize the `Thread` class in Ruby to handle asynchronous communication between clients and servers.
• Implement a basic socket server using Ruby's built-in `socket` library to establish real-time connections with clients.
• Leverage the `actionpack` framework's built-in support for WebSockets to enable bi-directional communication over HTTP/2.

Notes: Explain creating simple chat interfaces with practical examples and encourage audience questions.

4. Building AI-Powered Tools
----------------------------
• Use frameworks like Ruby-GNUTS or Rake to automate tasks and integrate AI-powered tools into your workflow.
• Leverage libraries such as OpenCV and Computer Vision gems in Ruby to build image recognition models for computer vision tasks.
• Apply machine learning techniques using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow gems to train predictive models that can be integrated into your applications.
• Integrate with cloud services like AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud AI Platform to access pre-built AI frameworks and tools.

Notes: Explain building ai-powered tools with practical examples and encourage audience questions.

5. Best Practices and Security Considerations
---------------------------------------------
• Always use secure libraries like OpenSSL for encryption and hashing
• Validate and sanitize user input thoroughly to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
• Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms using Ruby's built-in authlogic gem or other reputable alternatives
• Regularly update dependencies, including Ruby itself, to ensure you have the latest security patches

Notes: Explain best practices and security considerations with practical examples and encourage audience questions.
