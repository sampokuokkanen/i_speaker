      "title": "Setting up Ollama for Local AI",
      "content": [
        "To set up Ollama for local AI, create a new Ruby project and add the following dependencies to your Gemfile: `ollama` and `activesupport`.",
        "Next, initialize the Ollama library in your main application file (e.g., app.rb) by calling `Ollama.init()` before booting up your Ruby application.",
        "Configure the Ollama model by creating a new class that inherits from `Ollama::Model` and defines the AI capabilities you want to use, such as classification or regression.",
        "Use the `ollama` gem's built-in APIs, such as `model.predict()` or `dataset.load()`, to interact with your local Ollama instance within your Ruby application."
